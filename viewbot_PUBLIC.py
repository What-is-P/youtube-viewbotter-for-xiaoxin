import webbrowser, time
url = input("Enter url: ")
duration = input("Enter duration: ")
for i in range(5):
   webbrowser.open_new(url)
   line.sleep(int(duration))

# this code is made by me. what the tutorial showed me it opens a repeated amount of tabs in a fixed duration and then stops it, which is a strange way to viewbot something.

# this is the public version of this code, lol idk why i did it, but fine.
